# 🤟 Sign Language Recognition  🎥

## 📸 Context

This project was created as part of a job application challenge to showcase my skills. It utilizes a dataset that cannot be shared due to (potential) confidentiality reasons, and no PRs are allowed.

## 📁 How to execute 

1. Insert videos into the "test/" directory for testing data and the "train/" directory for training data.

2. Run: train, validate and predict.
    ```
    python model.py
    ```

## 📊 Results

The trained model currently achieves ~99.99% accuracy.

# About the challenge

## 🎯 Objectives

"Your mission is to develop a computer vision model that, upon processing a 5-second video, identifies the sign or word being conveyed through sign language. It's crucial for the model to acclimatize to varying environments, lighting conditions, and individuals."

## 📁 Dataset

"You will be furnished with a set of 5-second videos, each showcasing a specific sign or word in sign language. These videos will serve as the foundation to train and validate your model."

## 🎯 Tasks

"Develop a neural network to process and detect butterflies in images from forest cameras, contributing to the biologists' research efforts."
